# üå± Tree Plantation Robot ‚Äì NERC 2024 Prototype  

This repository documents the development of our **autonomous Tree Plantation Robot**, built for the **National Engineering Robotics Contest (NERC) 2024**.  

---

## üèÜ Contest Theme (NERC 2024)  
The theme for NERC 2024 was:  

- The arena consisted of a **3x3 grid** of cells.  
- Each cell initially contained a **rock** (represented by square wooden blocks).  
- The task was to:  
  1. Pick up each rock and place it at its designated drop zone.  
  2. Pick up a **tree object** (also a wooden block) and place it at the **original position of the removed rock**.  

Our robot was designed to **autonomously perform this rock-to-tree replacement process**, demonstrating precision in manipulation, motion planning, and control.

## ‚ö° Hardware Highlights

### 1. Custom H-Bridge PCB  
We designed and fabricated a dedicated **H-Bridge motor driver PCB** to efficiently control the DC motors, ensuring reliable motion and direction control.
